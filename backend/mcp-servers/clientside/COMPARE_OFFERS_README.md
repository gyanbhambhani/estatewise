  "message": "Compared 4 offers with GPT analysis",
  "data": {
    "comparison_id": "comparison_20240201_143022",
    "total_offers": 4,
    "ranked_offers": [
      {
        "price": 880000,
        "close_date": "2024-03-01T00:00:00",

    "pros_cons_table": [
      {
        "rank": 1,

      }
    ],
    "generated_at": "2024-02-01T14:30:22"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from client_tools import ClientTools

client_tools = ClientTools()
result = await client_tools.compare_offers(offers_list)
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
import { fetchFromMCPPost } from '@/utils/fetchFromMCP';

const response = await fetchFromMCPPost('clientside', {
  action: 'compare_offers',
  offers: offersData
});

if (response.success) {
  const analysis = response.data;
  console.log('GPT Summary:', analysis.summary);
  console.log('Pros/Cons:', analysis.pros_cons_table);
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see the tool in action:

```bash
cd backend
python test_compare_offers.py
```

This will demonstrate the tool with sample offer data and show:
- GPT-generated summary
- Ranked offers with scores
- Detailed pros/cons analysis

## Configuration

### OpenAI Integration
The tool requires an OpenAI API key for GPT analysis:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o
```

### Fallback Behavior
If GPT analysis fails or is unavailable, the tool falls back to:
- Basic algorithmic summary
- Rule-based pros/cons analysis
- Standard scoring system

## Error Handling

The tool gracefully handles:
- Missing or invalid offer data
- OpenAI API failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Malformed date strings
- Missing optional fields

## Performance

- **Async Operation**: Non-blocking GPT analysis
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second default timeout for API calls
- **Caching**: Results cached by comparison ID
- **Fallback**: Always provides analysis even if GPT fails

## Integration Points

This tool feeds into:
- **Seller Dashboard**: Display offer comparisons
- **Agent Tools**: Provide insights for client consultations
- **Reporting**: Generate offer analysis reports
- **Decision Support**: Help sellers choose the best offer
