# EstateWise Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The EstateWise project has been successfully refactored from a mixed structure to a clear separation between frontend and backend components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

**Before:**
```
estatewise/
├── apps/
│   └── frontend/          # Next.js frontend
├── mcp-servers/           # Backend MCP servers
├── shared/                # Shared utilities
├── test-mcp-servers.py    # Testing utilities
└── test_generate_comps.py # Testing utilities
```

**After:**
```
estatewise/
├── frontend/              # Next.js frontend
├── backend/               # All backend services
│   ├── mcp-servers/       # MCP servers
│   ├── shared/            # Shared utilities
│   ├── test-mcp-servers.py
│   └── test_generate_comps.py
└── [root config files]
```

### 2. Updated Configuration Files

#### dev.sh
- Updated paths for MCP servers: `backend/mcp-servers/[server]`
- Updated frontend path: `frontend/`

#### README.md
- Updated project structure diagram
- Updated manual setup instructions
- Updated testing instructions
- Updated deployment instructions

### 3. Fixed Import Paths

#### MCP Server Files
- Updated `sys.path.append()` calls in all main.py files
- Changed from `parent.parent.parent` to `parent.parent` for shared utils

#### Test Files
- Paths already correct after moving files to backend directory

### 4. Added Documentation

#### frontend/README.md
- Documentation for the Next.js frontend
- Setup and development instructions
- Key features overview

#### backend/README.md
- Documentation for all backend services
- MCP server descriptions and tools
- Setup and testing instructions

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Frontend and backend are now clearly separated
2. **Better Organization**: All backend-related code is in one place
3. **Easier Deployment**: Frontend and backend can be deployed independently
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make the codebase easier to navigate
5. **Team Collaboration**: Frontend and backend teams can work more independently

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- All import paths have been updated to work with the new structure
- The `dev.sh` script continues to work as before
- Testing utilities are now located in the backend directory

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new structure** by running `./dev.sh`
2. **Verify all MCP servers** start correctly
3. **Test frontend functionality** at http://localhost:3000
4. **Update any CI/CD pipelines** to reflect the new structure
5. **Update deployment scripts** if needed

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- All API endpoints remain the same
- All functionality works identically
- Only the internal file organization has changed
